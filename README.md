# Overview


I am trying to learn Java as i heard its a good in between when for python and C++. This will help me learn C++ a bit easier as i am transitioning from one end of coding to another. 


I have written code that will be able to make a guessing game that has limited attempts for the user to try, as well as a easy medium and hard mode to had an extra challenge.

I have written this to practice what its like to make a counting game in another language since one of my first games was in python where a user would set his own attempts for a guessing game.
